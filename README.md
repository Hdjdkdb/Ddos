## Disclaimer
This script is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of this script to conduct Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is **illegal** and punishable by law. Use this script responsibly and with permission from target network owners.

## Overview
This is a lightweight, asynchronous DDoS attack script optimized for use on Termux. It uses Pythonâ€™s `aiohttp` and `asyncio` to perform thousands of simultaneous HTTP requests to flood a target.

### Features
- **Asynchronous Requests**: High-speed, efficient requests without heavy system load.
- **Randomized User-Agent Headers**: Avoid detection with randomized requests.
- **Proxy Support**: Enhance anonymity by routing traffic through proxy servers.
- **GET/POST Requests**: Mix between GET and POST requests for a more versatile attack.
